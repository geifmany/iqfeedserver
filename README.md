# IQfeed API example
IQfeed is a financial data providor, I use the data for futures trading (NQ), my trading platform is in MATLAB so i used python only to fetch the data from IB and sent it to matlab using TCP.
In this repo i give the code sample for connecting to IQfeed requesting a feed and parsing it.
IQfeed api may be updated, I used it in 2016.
